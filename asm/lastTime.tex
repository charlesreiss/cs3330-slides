    \item processors $\leftrightarrow$ memory, I/O devices
        \begin{itemize}
        \item processor: send addresses (+ values, sometimes)
        \item memory: reply with values (or store value)
        \item some addresses correspond to I/O devices
        \item type of value read: why did processor read it?
        \end{itemize}
    \item endianness: little = least address is least significant
        \begin{itemize}
            \item little endian: {\tt 0x12\,34}: {\tt 0x34} at address $x+0$ 
            \item big endian: {\tt 0x12\,34}: {\tt 0x12} at address $x+0$
        \end{itemize}
    \item object files and linking
        \begin{itemize}
        \item relocations: ``fill in the blank'' with final addresses
        \item symbol table: location of labels within file
        \item memory addresses not decided until final executable
        \end{itemize}
