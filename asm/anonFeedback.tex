    \item on Collab, I appreciate it --- especially \textit{specific} feedback:
    \item {\small``The way that topics were introduced in class today was really confusing for me. When Prof. Reiss discussed the I/O bridge, he didn't first explain what each element was, making his explanation of the whole system extremely difficult to understand for those of us who didn't know what he was talking about. The explanation of Endianness also was confusing, and really would've been helped along by referencing a decimal number that makes more sense to the students rather than a hex number, which most people aren't nearly as comfortable with. Please consider changing your style of explanation to make the concepts more clear.''}
    \item Hm --- 2150 doesn't cover processors the way I thought\ldots
