\begin{frame}{replacement policy}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item since disks are so slow, replacement policy really matters
    \item will be implemented in software
        \vspace{.5cm}
    \item like with caches: something like least-recently-used usually good
        \begin{itemize}
        \item but exceptions: some access patterns won't work well
        \end{itemize}
    \item hardware help: can help OS know if pages were used
        \begin{itemize}
        \item typical solution: accessed bit (similar to dirty bit) in page table entries
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
