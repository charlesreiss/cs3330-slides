\begin{frame}{homework: C environment}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item get Unix-like environment with a C compiler
    \item will have department accounts, hopefully by end of week
        \begin{itemize}
        \item portal.cs.virginia.edu or NX
        \item instructions off course website (Collab)
        \end{itemize}
    \item some other options:

        \item some assignments can use OS X natively
        \item some assignments can Windows Subsystem for Linux natively

\begin{frame}{assignment compatibility}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item supported platform: department machines
    \item many use laptops 
    \item trouble? we'll say to use department machines
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item most assignments: C and Unix-like environment
    \item also: tool written in Rust --- but we'll provide binaries
        \begin{itemize}
        \item previously written in D + needed D compiler
        \end{itemize}
