\begin{frame}{data path versus control path}
\begin{itemize}
    \item data path --- signals carrying ``actual data''
    \item control path --- signals that control MUXes, etc.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item fuzzy line: e.g. are condition codes part of control path?
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item we will often omit parts of the control path in drawings, etc.
\end{itemize}
