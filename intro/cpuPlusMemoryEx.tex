    \begin{itemize}
    \item suppose a processor is executing the following instruction \\
        \texttt{movq \%rax, 0x123400} (AT\&T syntax) \\
        \texttt{MOV [0x123400], \%rax} (Intel syntax)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item which moves the value of \%rax to memory location \texttt{0x123400}
        \end{itemize}
    \item in the processor + memory bus model, how many times is a message sent
        from the processor to the memory?
    \end{itemize}
