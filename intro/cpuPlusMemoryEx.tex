    \begin{itemize}
    \item suppose a processor is executing the following instruction \\
        \texttt{movq 0x123400, \%rax} (AT\&T syntax) \\
        \texttt{MOV \%rax, [0x123400], \%rax} (Intel syntax)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item which moves the value of memory location \texttt{0x123400} to \%rax
        \end{itemize}
    \item in the processor + memory bus model, how many times is a message sent
        from the processor to the memory?
    \item<2> \iftoggle{heldback}{~}{answer: 2 (retrieve instruction + ask for address 0x123400)}
