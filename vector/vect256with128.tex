\begin{frame}{256-bit with 128-bit?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Intel designed 256-bit vector instructions with 128-bit ones in mind
    \item goal: possible to use 128-bit vector ALUs to implement 256-bit instructions
        \begin{itemize}
        \item split 256-bit instruction into two ALU operations
        \end{itemize}
    \item means less instructions move values from top to bottom half of vector
        \begin{itemize}
        \item in particular, complicated to move 16-bit value between halfs
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{aside on AVX and clock speeds}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item some processors ran slower when 256-bit ALUs are being used
        \begin{itemize}
        \item includes a lot of notable Intel CPUs
        \end{itemize}
    \item why? they give out heat --- can't maintain higher clock speed
        \begin{itemize}
        \item for energy reasons, shut down when not used
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item still faster \textit{assuming you're using vectors a lot}
    \end{itemize}
