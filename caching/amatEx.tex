\begin{frame}{AMAT exercise (1)}
\begin{itemize}
\item 90\% cache hit rate
\item hit time is 2 cycles
\item 30 cycle miss penalty
\item what is the average memory access time?
\item<2-> \iftoggle{heldback}{}{5 cycles}
\vspace{.5cm}
\item suppose we could increase hit rate by increasing its size, but it would increase the hit time to 3 cycles
\item how much do we have to increase the hit rate for this to not increase AMAT?
\item<3-> \iftoggle{heldback}{}{miss rate of 2/30 $\rightarrow$ approx 93\% hit rate}
\end{itemize}
