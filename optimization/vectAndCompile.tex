\begin{frame}[fragile,label=explicitVec]{vector instructions and compilers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item compilers can sometimes figure out how to use vector instructions
        \begin{itemize}
        \item (and have gotten much, much better at it over the past decade)
        \end{itemize}
    \item but easily messsed up:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item by aliasing
        \item by conditionals
        \item by some operation with no vector instruction
        \item \ldots
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
