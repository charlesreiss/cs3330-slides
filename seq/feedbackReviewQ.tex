\begin{itemize}
\item 
``How on earth do you except us to answer a similar question on the quiz as the 
final example during class, to which you gave a half-explained answer? \ldots'' (paraphrased:) and your
explanation didn't give a yes/no answer to yes/no questions
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{the question last week}
\begin{itemize}
    \item nop+add --- where do we need a MUX (or similar logic)?
\vspace{.5cm}
\item register to read --- no; read and ignore result on nop
    \begin{itemize}
    \item but `cleaner' to specify no register explicitly??
    \end{itemize}
\item PC input --- yes; need to handle instruction length
\item register \#/value to write --- yes (either one); don't change register on nop
    \begin{itemize}
    \item register number for ``none'' (15) \textit{or} new value = old value
    \end{itemize}
\item instruction memory address --- no; always equal to PC output
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{the question this week}
\begin{itemize}
\item jmp+addq+mrmovq
\vspace{.5cm}
\item read reg. \# --- no; read and ignore for jmp
\item PC input --- yes; varibale instruction length, jumps
\item write reg. \# --- need MUX on this \textit{or register value input}
\item write enable for memory --- no; hard-wire to false
\item address input to instruction memory --- no; equal to PC output
\item ALU inputs --- yes; mrmovq needs to add constant from instruction
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{anonymous feedback (2)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item (paraphrased) the question on timing on the post-quiz was unfair since it was in next week's textbook material
        \vspace{.5cm}
    \item intention: how addq CPU + register file + registers worked
    \item (but, yes, easier if you had read ahead)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{anonymous feedback (3)}
\begin{itemize}
\item (paraphrased) competition scoreboard for bomb HW was intimidating/demoralizing
\vspace{.5cm}
\item competitions make \textit{some} of our students learn more
\item I like it better than extra credit because it's more optional
\vspace{.5cm}
\item But better ways of making it feel optional?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item really should be no obligation to do more than assignment says
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{anonymous feedback (4)}
\begin{itemize}
\item (paraphrased) you should drop any question most students get wrong on the quizzes
    \vspace{.5cm}
\item I think this policy would create some perverse incentives
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{anonymous feedback (4)}
\begin{itemize}
\item (paraphrased) please check your slides more carefully
\end{itemize}
