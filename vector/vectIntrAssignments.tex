\begin{frame}{intrinsics in assignments}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item smooth assignment: you will use instriniscs
    \item disabled compiler vectorization
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item goal: you understand how vectorization optimization works
    \item goal: in case you needed to do more than compiler would do
        \begin{itemize}
        \item missing ``pattern'' for how to use vectors, aliasing, code size tradeoffs, \ldots
        \end{itemize}
