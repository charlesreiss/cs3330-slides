\begin{frame}[label=RISCwhy]{Why RISC?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item complex instructions were usually not faster
            \begin{itemize}
            \item (even though programs with simple instructions were bigger)
            \end{itemize}
        \item complex instructions were harder to implement
        \item compilers were replacing hand-written assembly
            \begin{itemize}
            \item correct assumption: almost no one will write assembly anymore
            \item incorrect assumption: okay to recompile frequently
            \end{itemize}
