\begin{frame}{assignment compatibility}
    \begin{itemize}

    \item many use laptops 
    \item trouble? we'll say to use department machines
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item most assignments: C and Unix-like environment
    \item also: tool written in Rust --- but we'll provide binaries
        \begin{itemize}
        \item previously written in D + needed D compiler
