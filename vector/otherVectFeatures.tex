    \begin{itemize}
    \item more flexible vector instruction features:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item invented in the 1990s
        \item often present in GPUs and being rediscovered by modern ISAs
        \end{itemize}
    \item reasonable conditional handling
    \item better variable-length vectors
    \item ability to load/store non-contiguous values
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item some of these features in AVX2/AVX512
    \end{itemize}
