\begin{frame}{prefetching}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item seems like we can't really improve cold misses\ldots
    \item have to have a miss to bring value into the cache?
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2-> solution: don't require miss: `prefetch' the value before it's accessed
    \item<2-> remaining problem: how do we know what to fetch?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{common access patterns}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item suppose recently accessed 16B cache blocks are at:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item 0x48010, 0x48020, 0x48030, 0x48040
        \end{itemize}
    \item guess what's accessed next
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2-> common pattern with \myemph{instruction fetches} and \myemph{array accesses}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{prefetching idea}
\begin{itemize}
\item look for sequential accesses
\item bring in guess at next-to-be-accessed value
\item if right: no cache miss (even if never accessed before)
\item if wrong: possibly evicted something else --- could cause more misses
    \begin{itemize}
    \item fortunately, sequential access guesses almost always right
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
