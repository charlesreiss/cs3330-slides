\begin{itemize}
\item reorder calculation to reduce cache misses:
\item make \myemph{explicit choice} about what is in cache
\item perform calculations in \myemph{cache-sized blocks}
\item get more spatial and temporal locality
\item temporal locality --- \myemph{reuse values} in many calculations
    \begin{itemize}
    \item before they are replaced in the cache
    \end{itemize}
\item spatial locality --- use \myemph{adjacent values} in calculations
    \begin{itemize}
    \item before cache block is replaced
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
