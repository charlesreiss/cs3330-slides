\begin{frame}{hazards versus dependencies}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item dependency --- X needs result of instruction Y?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item has potential for being messed up by pipeline
                \item (since part of X may run before Y finishes)
            \end{itemize}
        \item hazard --- will it not work in some pipeline?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \myemph{before} extra work is done to ``resolve'' hazards
                \item multiple kinds: so far, \textit{data hazards}
            \end{itemize}
